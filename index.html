<p>I am taking this class to learn more about how websites and codes work. I am very interested in knowing what happens behind the scenes of a Web Designer. There's a lot of hardwork put into creating a successful website.</p>
</p>I hope to achieve the profession understanding a great amount of how to comprehend code and building an http:// from scratch to eventually create my own.</p> 
 <p>The technologies I'm interested is the instruments of applications on the computer like Text Mate mastering this product</p>
