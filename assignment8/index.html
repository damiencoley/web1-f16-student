	<h1> Why do I need a Personal Portfolio
	</h1>
	<p>
	I need a personal portfolio to showcase my flavor and strength in art. It is important to have a stacked portfolio with visual elements. It tells a lot about who you are, what type of art you develop, and also your creativity in life through thoughts and observation. People feel your art before you feel their needs and from there it's what connects the audience to the artist.
	</p>
	<p>
	Having a portfolio shows the professional side of you being organzied and serious about you beimg an artist.
	</p>
	<p>
	Having a central place where the audience can connect and find you is also important to my portfolio website setup.
